    Load the published pexe.
    Note: Since this module does not use any real-estate in the browser, its
    width and height are set to 0.

    Note: The <embed> element is wrapped inside a <div>, which has both a 'load'
    and a 'message' event listener attached.  This wrapping method is used
    instead of attaching the event listeners directly to the <embed> element to
    ensure that the listeners are active before the NaCl module 'load' event
    fires.  This also allows you to use PPB_Messaging.PostMessage() (in C) or
    pp::Instance.PostMessage() (in C++) from within the initialization code in
    your module.
